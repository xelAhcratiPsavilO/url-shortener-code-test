# Url Shortener Code Test

A simple web app to shorten URLs.

## Getting started

### Running the server

Type in the CLI:
```
$ rackup
```

CLI outputs a port and gives a URL in the following format `localhost:XXXX`.  

Visiting that URL in a web browser displays `Welcome to the URL shortener`.

### Running the tests

Type in your CLI:
```
$ rspec
```
